##Background and Motivation

**1. Background**  
Inspired by Xiaoqun’s week 2 reflection about a video named ‘Humanity's cultural history captured in 5-minute film’. Which demonstrate 120,000 individuals who were notable enough in their lifetimes that the dates and locations of their births and deaths were recorded.   

The other website: http://peoplemov.in/ shows the global immigration flow at 2010. We want to further visualize the trend of immigration based on different attributes like a year, GDP, a war zone. Our goal is to explore the reason behind the immigration flow. The connection between viz and reader, considered.  

**2. Motivation**  
We are all international students who decided to move to another country to study. Therefore, we are curious about what stimulates people to live in another country. The war? The population density? Alternatively, any other reasons.  

##Project Objective

**1. Questions to be Solved**  
In our meeting, we found two categories of the question to be solved by visualization. The first one is to figure out the global/general migration pattern; the second one is to explore the migration pattern for one specific country. Not only the migration volume and migration direction but also the situation for those countries will be presented in our attempts.  

**2. Things to Learn and to Accomplish**  
In this project, we could learn how to design a web page and how to organize and present the dataset in a way that consumers are willing to take a look. What’s more, we will learn how to combine different charts with various visualization idioms to achieve our goal. What we will accomplish is a web page contains well-organized visualizations and descriptions to tell a story.  

**3. Benefits.**  
Capitalizing the powerful D3 library in this project, we can enhance our proficiency in JavaScript as well as front-end design technics. Our goal is to build a user-friendly  interface, which provides us a great opportunity to get exposure in human interaction design field. Finally, the most important thing is that, by aggregating multiple attributes data set, we can learn how to convey the information concisely to the users, which is the key to implement a great visualization.  

##Data

For the dataset, the first problem is where to collect the migration data. For the migration data, we found two data sources that have different durations and a different country(which might take a lot of time to clean the data). In the further discussion, We decided to add more features in our visualization, that is the reason why we introduced world population data by country in our dataset.  

**1. Migration flow till 2009.**  
http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/migrationflows.shtml (Contains Migration data from 2000 to 2009, divided by Country(region, developed or developing country) or by citizenship)  
**2. Migration bilateral matrix data at 2010,2013.**  
https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/migrationremittancesdiasporaissues/brief/migration-remittances-data  
**3. World population data(by country)**
